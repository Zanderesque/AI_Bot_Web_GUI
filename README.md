# Trading Dashboard - README

## Overview
This **Trading Dashboard** is a Python-based application that integrates **real-time sentiment analysis**, **account monitoring**, and **trading capabilities** using the **Alpaca API**. The system scrapes news from cryptocurrency and stock websites, analyzes sentiment using **TextBlob** and **FinBERT**, and places trades based on that analysis. It also provides account management features like equity, buying power, and trading restrictions.

## Key Features:

### 1. **Account Monitoring**:
- Fetches account details: account ID, equity, cash balance, buying power.
- Alerts on trading restrictions: Notifies if the account is blocked or flagged as a **Pattern Day Trader (PDT)**.
- Provides additional insights, such as whether **short-selling** is enabled.

### 2. **Trade Execution Panel**:
- Allows users to place **market**, **limit**, and **bracket orders** with **stop-loss** and **take-profit**.
- Executes trades using **Alpaca API** (MarketOrderRequest, LimitOrderRequest, StopLossRequest).

### 3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
- Real-time news scraping using **Selenium** to fetch cryptocurrency and stock market updates.
- **TextBlob** for basic sentiment polarity analysis and **FinBERT** for more accurate sentiment classification on financial news.

### 4. **Visualization**:
- **Chart.js** is used to display **trade history** over time, visualizing trade value and portfolio equity curves.

### 5. **Trade Updates**:
- **Alpaca Streaming API** listens for real-time trade updates (fills, cancels, rejections).
- Provides **feedback** on trade statuses.
