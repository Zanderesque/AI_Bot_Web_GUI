Trading Dashboard - README
Overview
This Trading Dashboard is built with Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend. It integrates real-time sentiment analysis, account monitoring, and trading capabilities using Alpaca API. The system scrapes news from cryptocurrency and stock websites, analyzes sentiment using TextBlob and FinBERT, and places trades based on that analysis. It also provides account management features, including equity, buying power, and trading restrictions.

Key Features:
1. Account Monitoring:
Fetches account details: account ID, equity, cash balance, buying power, etc.
Alerts on trading restrictions: Notifies if the account is trading blocked or flagged as a Pattern Day Trader (PDT).
Shows additional insights: Like short-selling enabled.
2. Trade Execution Panel:
Allows users to place market orders with stop-loss and take-profit via a modal dialog.
Executes trades using Alpaca API (MarketOrderRequest, LimitOrderRequest, StopLossRequest, etc.).
3. Sentiment Analysis:
Real-time news scraping using Selenium to fetch cryptocurrency and stock market updates.
Analyzes sentiment using TextBlob for basic sentiment and FinBERT for financial-specific sentiment analysis.
4. Visualization:
Chart.js is used to display trade history over time in Line Chart format, showing trade value and equity curves.
5. Trade Updates:
Alpaca Streaming API listens for real-time trade updates (fills, cancels, or rejections).
Provides feedback on trade statuses.
