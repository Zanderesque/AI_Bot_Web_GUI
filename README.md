npx create-react-app trading-dashboard
cd trading-dashboard
npm install axios @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled jsonwebtoken
Running the Application:
Start the Backend Server:

Features:
Mobile Responsiveness: The app layout is responsive on all devices. It adjusts the view using Material UI Grid components, ensuring smooth performance on both small and large screens.

Trade Execution Panel:

Modal Dialog for entering trade details (e.g., stop-loss and take-profit levels).
Allows users to place buy/sell trades directly from the GUI with advanced order types.
User Authentication (JWT):

Secure login with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
Protects routes and allows role-based access control, where users can manage their trades and settings securely.
JWT is used to store tokens in the frontend’s localStorage, maintaining user sessions across different pages.
Example:
Login Endpoint:

Users authenticate with their credentials, and the server generates a JWT token.
This token is then used for all protected API calls.
Trade Execution:

Users can input the stop-loss and take-profit percentages before executing trades.
Trade history is displayed for all executed trades.
Mobile Responsiveness:
The app is designed with Material UI’s Grid system, making it fully responsive and optimized for both mobile and desktop views.

javascript
Copy code
<Grid container spacing={2}>
    <Grid item xs={12} sm={6}>
        <TextField
            label="Search Symbol"
            variant="outlined"
            fullWidth
        />
    </Grid>
    <Grid item xs={12} sm={6}>
        <Button variant="contained" fullWidth>Search</Button>
    </Grid>
</Grid>
Trade Execution Panel (Modal):
Users can input stop-loss and take-profit levels via a modal dialog before executing their trades. The modal component leverages Material UI’s Dialog component:

javascript
Copy code
const TradeModal = ({ open, onClose, onSubmit }) => {
  const [stopLoss, setStopLoss] = useState('');
  const [takeProfit, setTakeProfit] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = () => {
    onSubmit(stopLoss, takeProfit);
    onClose();
  };

  return (
    <Dialog open={open} onClose={onClose}>
      <DialogTitle>Enter Trade Details</DialogTitle>
      <DialogContent>
        <TextField
          label="Stop-Loss (%)"
          variant="outlined"
          fullWidth
          value={stopLoss}
          onChange={(e) => setStopLoss(e.target.value)}
        />
        <TextField
          label="Take-Profit (%)"
          variant="outlined"
          fullWidth
          value={takeProfit}
          onChange={(e) => setTakeProfit(e.target.value)}
        />
      </DialogContent>
      <DialogActions>
        <Button onClick={onClose}>Cancel</Button>
        <Button onClick={handleSubmit} variant="contained" color="primary">Submit</Button>
      </DialogActions>
    </Dialog>
  );
};
User Authentication with JWT:
The backend uses JWT for secure user authentication. Users must log in to receive a token, which is stored in localStorage on the frontend for session management.

javascript
Copy code
const login = async (username, password) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5000/login', { username, password });
    localStorage.setItem('token', response.data.token);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Login failed', error);
  }
};
Conclusion:
This Trading Dashboard provides a modern interface for managing trades, tracking performance, and securely executing transactions. It leverages real-time data from Alpaca and CoinGecko for stock and cryptocurrency market analysis. The app is mobile-responsive, includes a trade execution panel, and uses JWT for secure authentication, making it suitable for professional traders and enthusiasts alike.
